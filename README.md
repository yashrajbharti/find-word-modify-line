# find-word-modify-line
This python code helps in advanced find and replace scenarios. Here the user wants to modify the whole sentence containing the word and not just replace the word itself. In my case I needed to find the word "DATE" and grab the date from that line and then put it to next line inside the TimeSpan tag.

## To run  
`python3 findandreplace.py`
